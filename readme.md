## Web Image Editor Sample for Java(Spring 4) ##

This is an example of an image editor using the [PaintWeb](http://mihai.sucan.ro/paintweb/trunk/demos/demo1.html)(JavaScript) library

While you can have experience with image editing on the PaintWeb demo site,

There is not much documentation on how to use this library.

Especially, since there is no sample code to save the edited image, i made an example in Java(Spring 4).

And Several features have been added to the basic functionality of PaintWeb.

### Added features ###
- Rotate image
- Input string in canvas
- Save image as zoom state
- Add part of Korean(ko.json)
 
 
### Development environment ###
    Programming Language - Java 1.7
    IDE - Eclipse
    Framework - Spring 4
    Build Tool - Maven
